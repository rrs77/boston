## ðŸ”§ Critical Fixes Verified:

### 1. **Category Groups Persistence** âœ…
- **Issue:** Category groups were disappearing immediately after creation
- **Fix Applied:** 
  - Added missing `useEffect` for automatic persistence
  - Fixed real-time subscription to process all events
  - Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- **Result:** Category groups now persist correctly across sessions

### 2. **Year Groups Synchronization** âœ…
- **Issue:** New year groups not syncing across browsers
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Enhanced real-time subscriptions with fallback polling
  - Improved upsert logic with DELETE + INSERT strategy
  - Added unique channel names to prevent conflicts
- **Result:** Year groups sync reliably across all browser sessions

### 3. **Sequential Lesson Numbering** âœ…
- **Issue:** Lessons showing original library numbers instead of sequential
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Added `displayNumber` prop to `LessonLibraryCard`
  - Updated `UnitViewer` to pass sequential index
- **Result:** Lessons now display as 1, 2, 3... within units

### 4. **Multi-Group Category Assignment** âœ…
- **Issue:** Categories could only be assigned to one group
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Updated `Category` interface to support `groups[]` array
  - Modified UI to support multi-select for groups
  - Updated database schema with migration
- **Result:** Categories can now be assigned to multiple groups

### 5. **Database Schema Consistency** âœ…
- **Issue:** Missing columns and inconsistent table references
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Added missing `group` and `groups` columns to `custom_categories`
  - Standardized table name usage via `TABLES` constant
  - Created proper migration scripts
- **Result:** Database schema is now complete and consistent
