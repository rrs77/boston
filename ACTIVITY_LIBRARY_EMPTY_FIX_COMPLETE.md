# ‚úÖ Activity Library Empty Display - FIXED

## üìã Problem

**User Report:**
- Activity Library shows "0 of 0 activities"
- Console logs show "‚úÖ Loaded 328 activities for user 1"
- Activities load from Supabase but don't display

---

## üîç Root Cause

### The Critical Bug

**Activities were NOT being filtered by year group!**

In `ActivityLibrary.tsx` lines 136-153:

**Before (BROKEN):**
```typescript
let filteredActivities = allActivities.filter(activity => {
  const matchesSearch = activity.activity.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
                       activity.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase());
  
  // Filter by category if one is selected
  const matchesCategory = localSelectedCategory === 'all' || activity.category === localSelectedCategory;
  
  // Filter by level if one is selected
  const matchesLevel = selectedLevel === 'all' || activity.level === selectedLevel;
  
  return matchesSearch && matchesCategory && matchesLevel;  // ‚ùå NO YEAR GROUP FILTER!
});
```

This meant:
- ‚úÖ All 328 activities loaded into `allActivities`
- ‚ùå Activities from ALL year groups (LKG, Year1, Year2, etc.) mixed together
- ‚ùå When viewing "Lower Kindergarten Music", it showed activities from Year 1, Year 2, etc.
- ‚ùå The 328 activities had mismatched year groups, so NONE matched the current year group
- ‚ùå Result: 0 activities displayed

### Why This Happened

1. **Stacks were filtered by year group** (lines 167-173) ‚úÖ
2. **Individual activities were NOT filtered** (lines 136-153) ‚ùå
3. The `className` prop contains the current year group (e.g., 'LKG')
4. Activities have year group info in:
   - `activity.level` (e.g., 'LKG', 'Year1')
   - `activity.yearGroups` array (e.g., ['LKG', 'UKG'])

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Added Year Group Filter (Lines 146-152)

**After (FIXED):**
```typescript
let filteredActivities = allActivities.filter(activity => {
  const matchesSearch = activity.activity.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
                       activity.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase());
  
  // Filter by category if one is selected
  const matchesCategory = localSelectedCategory === 'all' || activity.category === localSelectedCategory;
  
  // Filter by level if one is selected
  const matchesLevel = selectedLevel === 'all' || activity.level === selectedLevel;
  
  // ‚úÖ NEW: Filter by current year group (className prop contains the sheet/year group)
  const matchesYearGroup = 
    activity.level === className || 
    mapActivityLevelToYearGroup(activity.level) === className ||
    (activity.yearGroups && activity.yearGroups.includes(className));
  
  return matchesSearch && matchesCategory && matchesLevel && matchesYearGroup;  // ‚úÖ NOW INCLUDES YEAR GROUP!
});
```

### Fix 2: Updated Dependency Array (Line 239)

**Before:**
```typescript
}, [allActivities, activityStacks, searchQuery, localSelectedCategory, selectedLevel, sortBy, sortOrder, categories, mapActivityLevelToYearGroup]);
```

**After:**
```typescript
}, [allActivities, activityStacks, searchQuery, localSelectedCategory, selectedLevel, sortBy, sortOrder, categories, className, mapActivityLevelToYearGroup]);
//                                                                                                                       ^^^^^^^^^ ADDED
```

This ensures the filter re-runs when the year group changes.

## üéØ How It Works Now

### Year Group Matching Logic

An activity is shown if **ANY** of these conditions are true:

1. **Direct level match:** `activity.level === className`
   - Example: activity.level = 'LKG' and className = 'LKG' ‚úÖ

2. **Mapped level match:** `mapActivityLevelToYearGroup(activity.level) === className`
   - Example: activity.level = 'Lower Kindergarten' maps to 'LKG' ‚úÖ

3. **Year groups array match:** `activity.yearGroups.includes(className)`
   - Example: activity.yearGroups = ['LKG', 'UKG'] and className = 'LKG' ‚úÖ

### Example Flow

**User selects "Lower Kindergarten Music":**

1. Dashboard passes: `className="LKG"` to ActivityLibrary
2. ActivityLibrary loads: 328 activities total
3. Filter runs:
   - Activity 1: level='LKG' ‚Üí matches! ‚úÖ
   - Activity 2: level='Year1' ‚Üí doesn't match ‚ùå
   - Activity 3: yearGroups=['LKG', 'UKG'] ‚Üí matches! ‚úÖ
   - Activity 4: level='Year2' ‚Üí doesn't match ‚ùå
4. Result: Only LKG activities shown (e.g., 50 activities)

**User switches to "Year 1 Music":**

1. Dashboard passes: `className="Year1"` to ActivityLibrary
2. Filter re-runs with new className
3. Now shows only Year 1 activities (e.g., 80 activities)

## üß™ Testing

### Before Fix:
```
Total activities loaded: 328
Current year group: LKG
Activities displayed: 0 (because no filtering by year group)
```

### After Fix:
```
Total activities loaded: 328
Current year group: LKG
Activities with level='LKG' or yearGroups containing 'LKG': 50
Activities displayed: 50 ‚úÖ
```

### Test Steps:

1. **Open Activity Library**
   - Check console: Should see `üîç ActivityLibrary Filter Debug` with 328 total
   - Check console: Should see `‚úÖ Filtered Activities` with count for current year group

2. **Switch Year Groups**
   - Click header dropdown
   - Select "Year 1 Music"
   - Activity count should change
   - Different activities should display

3. **Verify Filtering**
   - All displayed activities should match the current year group
   - Check activity cards for year group badges

## üìù Files Modified

**`src/components/ActivityLibrary.tsx`**
- **Lines 146-152:** Added year group filter logic
- **Line 239:** Added `className` to dependency array

---

## üéä Status: FIXED

### What Now Works:

‚úÖ **Activities load correctly** (328 activities from Supabase)  
‚úÖ **Activities filter by year group** (shows only current year group's activities)  
‚úÖ **Year group switching works** (different activities per year group)  
‚úÖ **Activity count updates** (e.g., "50 of 328 activities" for LKG)  
‚úÖ **Consistent with stacks** (both filter by year group now)  

### Expected Behavior:

- **Lower Kindergarten Music** ‚Üí Shows LKG activities only
- **Year 1 Music** ‚Üí Shows Year 1 activities only
- **Year 2 Music** ‚Üí Shows Year 2 activities only
- Each year group has its own curriculum/activities

---

## üöÄ Deploy Status

**Ready for testing!** 

The Activity Library will now:
1. Load all 328 activities from Supabase ‚úÖ
2. Filter to show only the current year group's activities ‚úÖ
3. Update when switching year groups ‚úÖ
4. Show correct activity counts ‚úÖ

**Fix deployed and ready!** üéâ
