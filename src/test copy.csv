Acha, bacha, cucaracha:
Tap knees for the first beat and clap for the next three beats
acha, bacha, boo (rest):

Tap knees for the first beat, clap for the next two beats, and jump round to face outwards during the fourth beat (Repeat for lines three and four, jumping to face inwards)

Game One:

The children stand in a circle, evenly spaced. One child (A) goes into the centre with a ball. The ball will be bounced to the four beats in a line: A bounces the ball (first beat), catches it himself (second beat), passes it to someone else (third beat), who passes it back to A (fourth beat). If there is a rest at the end of the phrase (lines two and four), the chosen child doesn't pass it back but changes places with the child in the centre, becoming the new A.

Acha, bacha, cucaracha: acha, bacha, boo (rest):
Acha, bacha, cucaracha: our go you! (rest):
Bounce, catch, pass, pass
Bounce, catch, pass - change places
Bounce, catch, pass, pass
Bounce, catch, pass - change places

Game Two:

The children stand in a circle evenyl spaced. 

The action in the first two lines la ox in Game One. However, during the final rest (at the end of the fourth line the child now holding the boll runs with it round the outside of the circle, chased by the current child A. If he is caught before he reaches his own space again, he gives the ball back and A returns to the centre. If he is not caught, he keeps the ball and becomes the new A
