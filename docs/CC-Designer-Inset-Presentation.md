# CC Designer: A Comprehensive Curriculum Planning Tool
## Inset Presentation Guide

---

## Introduction

**CC Designer** (Creative Curriculum Designer) is a powerful, web-based application designed to streamline curriculum planning, lesson creation, and resource management for teachers across all subjects and year groups. This tool transforms how educators plan, organize, and deliver their curriculum, making it easier to create structured lessons, track curriculum coverage, and share resources with colleagues.

---

## What is CC Designer?

CC Designer is a comprehensive curriculum planning platform that allows teachers to:

- **Create and manage activities** that can be reused across multiple lessons
- **Build structured lessons** by combining activities in logical sequences
- **Organize lessons into units and half-terms** for long-term planning
- **Track curriculum objectives** and ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Share lessons and resources** with colleagues easily
- **Export lessons** as PDFs for printing or sharing
- **Customize categories and year groups** to match your school's structure

The application is cloud-based, meaning your work is automatically saved and accessible from any device with internet access. It's designed to be intuitive, requiring minimal training while providing powerful features for experienced users.

## Key Features

### 1. Activity Library

The Activity Library is the foundation of CC Designer. Here, teachers can:

- **Create reusable activities** with detailed instructions, resources, and links
- **Search and filter** activities by category, year group, or keyword
- **Attach resources** including videos, audio files, worksheets, and online links
- **Link curriculum objectives** (EYFS or custom objectives) to activities
- **Organize by categories** that can be customized for your subject or school

**Why it's useful:** Instead of rewriting lesson content each time, teachers create activities once and reuse them across multiple lessons. This saves time and ensures consistency.

**Example:** A science teacher creates an activity called "Observing Plant Growth" with instructions, a video link, and a worksheet. This activity can be used in multiple lessons throughout the year, adapted for different year groups.

---

### 2. Lesson Builder

The Lesson Builder is where activities come together to form complete lessons:

- **Drag and drop** activities into your lesson plan
- **Organize activities** into logical sequences (starter, main, plenary)
- **Auto-calculate duration** based on activity times
- **Add lesson notes** and learning objectives
- **Preview lessons** before saving
- **Edit existing lessons** easily

**Why it's useful:** Teachers can quickly build well-structured lessons by selecting from their library of activities. The visual interface makes it easy to see the lesson flow and timing.

**Example:** An English teacher building a lesson on poetry:
- Starter: "Poetry Warm-up" activity (5 minutes)
- Main: "Analyzing Metaphors" activity (20 minutes)
- Main: "Writing Your Own Metaphors" activity (15 minutes)
- Plenary: "Sharing and Reflection" activity (10 minutes)

Total lesson time: 50 minutes (automatically calculated)

---

### 3. Unit Viewer (Half-Term Planner)

The Unit Viewer helps teachers organize lessons into half-terms and units:

- **View all lessons** for a specific half-term at a glance
- **Assign lessons** to half-terms for long-term planning
- **Track progress** through units and terms
- **See curriculum coverage** across the academic year
- **Organize by teaching units** or topics

**Why it's useful:** Teachers can see the big picture of their curriculum planning, ensuring balanced coverage across terms and identifying gaps or overlaps.

**Example:** A maths teacher can see all lessons planned for Autumn Term 1, grouped by topics (Number, Shape, Measurement), making it easy to ensure comprehensive coverage.

---

### 4. Lesson Library

The Lesson Library provides a central repository for all created lessons:

- **Browse all lessons** for your class or year group
- **Search and filter** lessons by title, week, or term
- **Share lessons** with colleagues via shareable links
- **Export lessons** as PDFs for printing or digital sharing
- **Edit or duplicate** existing lessons

**Why it's useful:** Teachers can quickly find previous lessons, adapt them for different classes, or share best practice with colleagues.

---

### 5. Settings & Customization

CC Designer is highly customizable to match your school's needs:

- **Create custom categories** for your subject (e.g., "Practical Investigation", "Group Discussion", "Independent Research")
- **Set up year groups** that match your school structure
- **Assign categories to year groups** to filter activities appropriately
- **Customize curriculum objectives** beyond EYFS standards
- **Manage subjects** and subject-specific categories

**Why it's useful:** The app adapts to your school's curriculum structure, whether you teach primary, secondary, or special educational needs. A PE teacher might have categories like "Warm-up", "Skills Practice", "Game Play", while a History teacher might use "Source Analysis", "Role Play", "Debate".

---

### 6. Resource Management

Every activity and lesson can include multiple types of resources:

- **Video links** (YouTube tutorials, demonstrations)
- **Audio files** (music, sound effects, recordings)
- **Online resources** (interactive games, websites, digital tools)
- **Teaching materials** (PDFs, worksheets, presentations)
- **Images** (diagrams, photos, visual aids)

**Why it's useful:** All resources are linked directly to activities and lessons, so teachers don't need to search through folders or remember where files are stored. Everything is in one place.

---

### 7. Curriculum Tracking

CC Designer helps ensure comprehensive curriculum coverage:

- **Link activities** to curriculum objectives (EYFS or custom)
- **Track which objectives** are covered in each lesson
- **See coverage across** units and terms
- **Identify gaps** in curriculum delivery
- **Generate reports** on standards coverage

**Why it's useful:** Teachers and curriculum leaders can easily demonstrate that all required objectives are being covered, making it easier to prepare for inspections and reviews.
