# Create and Sync with Boston GitHub Repository

## 📝 Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub:**  
   Visit: https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in the details:**
   - **Repository name:** `boston`
   - **Description:** "Kent Curriculum Designer - Boston Version"
   - **Visibility:** Private (or Public, your choice)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have code)

3. **Click "Create repository"**

## 🚀 Step 2: Push Your Code (I've already prepared this)

Once you've created the repository on GitHub, come back here and run:

```bash
cd "/Users/robreich-storer/Desktop/Cursor New/cursorchanges"
git push boston main
```

✅ **The remote is already configured!** I've already added the `boston` remote, so you just need to create the repo on GitHub and push.

## 🔍 Check Current Status

Your git configuration:
```bash
git remote -v
```

Should show:
- `origin` → https://github.com/rrs77/cursorchanges
- `kentversion` → https://github.com/rrs77/kentversion
- `boston` → https://github.com/rrs77/boston.git ✨ (NEW!)
